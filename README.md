# Deep-Learning

Hi,

After I started sharing my machine learning notebooks in a repository I thought I can also edit my deep learning notes and provide some notebooks for people as well. Unfortunately, because of having limited time, I couldn't edit the notebooks much to make them educative. These notebooks are not as detailed as my machine-learning notebooks. They still include theory and application but not with a detailed explanation. These notebooks are more like combinations of the things I have done while I was learning the basics of deep learning.
