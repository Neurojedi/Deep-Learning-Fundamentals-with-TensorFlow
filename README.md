# Deep-Learning

Hi,

After I started releasing my machine learning notebooks in a repository I thought I can also edit my deep learning notes and provide some notebooks for people as well. Unfortunately, because of having limited time, I couldn't edit the notebooks much to make them educative. These notebooks are not as detailed as my machine learning notebooks. They still include theory and application but not with a detailed explanation. These notebook are more like combinations of the things I have done while I was learning deep learning. They include my working during I was taking the courses Deep Learning Specialization and DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization on Coursera. While taking these courses I also used two books for improving myself further, 1-) Hands on Hands ML with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow 
2-) Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet. I have combined my notes from Andrew NG's courses and exercises in these two books that I coded by myself, afterwards, I have done different exercises and added them into these notebooks too. Now I am revising these noteeboks and while doing that, I add some more exercises as well as explanations for code (still not detailed as much as my machine learning notes) and also I'm planning to share them here. As a result, these notebooks are actually my notes and exercises from different sources combined with some extra notes. I hope some people can also make use of them and expediete their learning process.

Contents:

1-) Deep Learning 1: Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, Simple Neural Networks

2-) Deep Learning 2: Implementation of a NN with 2 and L number of Hidden Layers, Catvsnoncat model implementation with Keras.

3-) Deep Learning 3: Exercises of MLP, Simple Neural Nets with Keras (No regularization and hyperparameters tuning)

will be updated
